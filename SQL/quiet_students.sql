Each row of this table indicates that the student with student_id had a score points in the exam with id exam_id.
 

A quiet student is the one who took at least one exam and did not score the highest or the lowest score.

Write a solution to report the students (student_id, student_name) being quiet in all exams. Do not return the student who has never taken any exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exams.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.
