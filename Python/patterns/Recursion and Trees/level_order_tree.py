"""
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Example1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []

    #Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
    #Space Complexity: O(n) for the levels list that stores the values of nodes at each level.
    #The recursion stack can also take O(h) space where h is the height of the tree, but in the worst case (skewed tree), h can be O(n).
    #Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n).
    #The time complexity is O(n) because we visit each node exactly once.
    #The space complexity is O(n) because we store the values of all nodes in the levels list.
