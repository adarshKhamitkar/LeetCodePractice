### Prompt:
## I want to build a data pipeline for Netflix playback events. The system should extract 125K events per second and should scale to extract 200K events per second too. I am thinking of writing a custom extractor in Apache Flink which can connect to Netflix's Web socket, pre-process and extract all the events. From Flink, the data will flow to Kafka topic for a retention of 24 hours. From Kafka topic I will have one more Flink instance to extract messages from kafka topic in real-time. Which can then be stored in Storage system like Apache Hudi-Hive tables. 
## Evaluate the above high level design and identify potential problems in the design and apply the improvements

### High-Level Design Evaluation

Your proposed architecture is a solid starting point for a real-time data pipeline handling high-volume streaming events from Netflix's playback system. It leverages Apache Flink for stream processing (which excels at low-latency, stateful computations), Kafka for durable buffering and decoupling, and Apache Hudi for efficient, ACID-compliant storage on Hive. This setup supports the required throughput (125K events/sec baseline, scaling to 200K) by distributing load across components and enabling horizontal scaling. Key strengths include:

- **Decoupling**: Extractor → Kafka → Consumer separation allows independent scaling and fault isolation.
- **Durability**: Kafka's 24-hour retention provides a replay buffer for recovery or reprocessing.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Flink's event-time processing and windowing can handle out-of-order events common in playback streams (e.g., pauses, seeks).
- **Storage Efficiency**: Hudi's upsert/merge-on-read capabilities suit frequent updates in event data, integrating well with Hive for analytics.

However, there are several potential issues in scalability, reliability, performance, and operational aspects. Below, I'll outline the key problems, categorized for clarity, followed by targeted improvements. These are based on common pitfalls in streaming pipelines at this scale (e.g., >100K eps), drawing from Flink/Kafka/Hudi best practices.

#### Potential Problems

1. **Extraction Bottleneck and WebSocket Limitations**:
   - WebSockets are connection-oriented and typically designed for single-client, bidirectional communication. A single Flink extractor job might overload the connection at 125K+ eps due to network latency, backpressure, or Netflix's rate limits/throttling (e.g., if they enforce connection pooling or auth tokens).
   - Scaling the Flink extractor horizontally (via parallelism) could require multiple WebSocket connections, risking IP bans, increased latency, or incomplete event capture if Netflix doesn't support fan-out.
   - Preprocessing (e.g., filtering, enrichment) in the extractor adds CPU/memory overhead, potentially causing backpressure or job instability under bursty loads.

2. **Dual Flink Jobs Overhead**:
   - Running two separate Flink clusters/jobs introduces unnecessary complexity: serialization/deserialization overhead between them, duplicated resource management (e.g., Yarn/K8s scheduling), and potential schema mismatches if event formats evolve.
   - The second Flink consumer might redundantly handle real-time extraction from Kafka, duplicating logic from the first job and risking inconsistent processing (e.g., different windowing or state).

3. **Kafka Throughput and Partitioning**:
   - At 200K eps, Kafka needs careful partitioning (e.g., 100+ partitions/topic) to avoid hot partitions, but poor keying (e.g., if events key on user ID) could skew load.
   - 24-hour retention is fine for short-term buffering but could lead to storage bloat (e.g., ~17TB/day at 1KB/event) without compression or tiered storage, increasing costs.
   - No explicit handling for exactly-once semantics or idempotency, risking duplicates during failures.

4. **Storage Layer Challenges**:
   - Hudi-Hive writes at high velocity can cause compaction bottlenecks or Hive metastore contention, especially with upserts (e.g., updating playback sessions).
   - Real-time ingestion into Hudi might lag under spikes, as merge operations are write-intensive; Hive queries could suffer from eventual consistency.
   - Schema evolution (e.g., new playback fields like ad skips) isn't addressed, potentially breaking downstream jobs.

5. **Reliability and Observability Gaps**:
   - Single extractor as a failure point: If the WebSocket disconnects (e.g., due to network issues), events could be lost without a failover mechanism.
   - No mention of checkpointing, error handling, or dead-letter queues (DLQs), leading to data loss or manual intervention.
   - Monitoring is absent: Hard to detect issues like rising latency, backpressure, or skewed partitions without metrics (e.g., via Prometheus/Grafana).
   - Security/Compliance: Playback events may contain PII (e.g., user IDs, content metadata); no encryption or access controls specified.

6. **Resource and Cost Efficiency**:
   - Scaling to 200K eps requires overprovisioning Flink/Kafka resources (e.g., 100+ cores, high-memory nodes), but without autoscaling, it could be wasteful during off-peaks.
   - End-to-end latency might exceed SLAs (e.g., >1s) due to hops (WebSocket → Flink → Kafka → Flink → Hudi).

#### Recommended Improvements

To address these, aim for a more resilient, scalable design with minimal changes to your core stack. I'll suggest iterative enhancements, prioritized by impact.

1. **Enhance Extraction for Scalability and Reliability**:
   - **Use Flink's Source Connectors with Fan-Out**: Replace the custom WebSocket connector with a scalable source like Flink's Kafka connector if Netflix exposes a Kafka-based feed (common for enterprise APIs). If stuck with WebSocket, implement a connection pool or proxy (e.g., via Apache NiFi or a lightweight load balancer) to distribute connections across Flink tasks. Set Flink parallelism to 50-100 for the extractor job to handle 200K eps (benchmark with ~2-4K eps per task).
   - **Offload Preprocessing**: Move heavy preprocessing (e.g., joins, aggregations) to the consumer Flink job. Keep the extractor lightweight (parse, validate, route) to minimize backpressure. Use Flink's async I/O for WebSocket reads.
   - **Add Failover**: Implement a secondary extractor with leader election (e.g., via ZooKeeper) or use Flink's high-availability mode with standby jobs.

2. **Streamline Processing with a Unified Flink Pipeline**:
   - **Merge Jobs into One**: Chain the extraction and consumption in a single Flink application (WebSocket source → Kafka sink for buffering → in-app processing → Hudi sink). This reduces latency (~50-100ms savings), simplifies ops, and ensures consistent state (e.g., shared checkpoints). Use Kafka as an intermediate sink only for durability, not re-extraction.
   - **If Keeping Separate**: Use Flink's Savepoints for seamless upgrades and schema registry (e.g., Confluent Schema Registry) to enforce compatibility between jobs.

3. **Optimize Kafka for High Throughput**:
   - **Partitioning and Keying**: Use event-time or session-based keys (e.g., user+timestamp) for even distribution. Start with 200 partitions/topic, monitor via Kafka's JMX metrics, and use Cruise Control for auto-rebalancing.
   - **Retention and Efficiency**: Enable compression (Snappy/LZ4) and tiered storage (Kafka 2.8+) to offload old data to S3. For exactly-once, configure Flink's Kafka connector with `enable.idempotence=true` and transactional producers.
   - **DLQ Integration**: Route failed events to a DLQ topic for later retry/analysis.

4. **Bolster Storage with Performance Tweaks**:
   - **Hudi Configuration**: Use Hudi's Copy-on-Write (CoW) for low-latency reads or Merge-on-Read (MoR) for faster writes; schedule async compaction every 1-2 hours. Partition Hudi tables by date/hour to avoid full scans.
   - **Alternative/Complement**: If Hive latency is an issue, layer Iceberg on top for better schema evolution and query federation (via Trino). Test write throughput with a POC at 200K eps.
   - **Schema Management**: Integrate Avro/Protobuf with a schema registry for backward-compatible changes.

5. **Add Reliability and Observability Layers**:
   - **Fault Tolerance**: Enable Flink checkpointing every 30-60s to S3, with restart strategies for transient failures. Use at-least-once semantics initially, upgrading to exactly-once post-testing.
   - **Monitoring Stack**: Integrate Flink's dashboard with Prometheus for metrics (e.g., throughput, latency, backpressure), ELK for logs, and alerting on thresholds (e.g., >10% event loss).
   - **Security**: Encrypt data in-transit (TLS for WebSocket/Kafka) and at-rest (Hudi encryption). Use role-based access (e.g., Kafka ACLs) and anonymize PII early in the extractor.

6. **Resource Scaling and Testing**:
   - **Autoscaling**: Deploy on Kubernetes with Keda or Flink's native autoscaler, targeting 70-80% CPU utilization.
   - **Benchmarking**: Run load tests with tools like Flink's Test Harness or Apache JMeter simulating 200K eps bursts. Measure E2E latency and tune (e.g., increase Kafka acks=1 for speed).
   - **Cost Optimization**: Use spot instances for non-critical Flink tasks; estimate ~$5K-10K/month on AWS for baseline scale (adjust via calculator).

#### Revised Architecture Sketch

- **Source**: Scalable WebSocket proxy → Flink Extractor (parallelism=100, lightweight parse).
- **Buffer**: Kafka (200 partitions, compressed, 24h retention + DLQ).
- **Processor/Sink**: Unified Flink job (consume Kafka → process → write Hudi-Hive).
- **Ops Layer**: Checkpointing + Monitoring.

This refined design should handle your scale with <1% data loss, sub-second latency, and easier maintenance. If you provide more details (e.g., event schema, cloud provider), I can refine further or sketch a diagram.
