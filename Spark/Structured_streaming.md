> Can you take my interview on a particular topic, i.e., Spark Structured Streaming

✦ Of course. Let's begin.


  What is Spark Structured Streaming and how does it differ from other streaming paradigms?

> Spark Structured streaming is a micro-batch streaming engine which utilizes the Spark's Dataframe and Dataset APIs to apply the logic on the incoming 
  streaming data. Structured streaming treats every incoming data as a micro-batch which will be configured through triggers. For every trigger, the 
  streaming API will pull pre-configured rows of data from source(Kafka topic). This is more suitable for near-real time streaming requirements, aka pull 
  model for Data extraction.

✦ That's a good start. You mentioned micro-batching and triggers.


  Could you elaborate on the different types of triggers available in Structured Streaming and how they impact latency and resource consumption?

> Triggers are impacted by the window and watermark configuration for the streaming job. Window and Watermark play a very cruicial role in late arriving 
  data for a stateful streaming operation, where an aggrigation logic is applied to the previous micro-batch. These previous micro batches are stored in a 
  state-store which is RocksDB or HDFS state store.

✦ You're touching on some important concepts: stateful streaming, windows, and watermarks. Let's break that down.


  You mentioned that the previous micro-batches are stored in a state store. Can you explain in more detail what a state store is, why it's necessary in
  stateful streaming, and what are the potential challenges associated with managing state in a long-running streaming application?

> Structured streaming basically offers 3 types of modes to manage the data. Complete mode, where the entire data is managed in the state store and a 
  aggregation logic will be applied completely to entire data in RocksDB and current-micro batch and applies a final merge, works more similar to insert 
  overwrite on the entire data in stateful operations. Update mode, updates only the affected parts of the data from any incoming micro-batch, hence it 
  updates the previously processed data from state-store with updated information in current micro-batch. Append mode works on appending the incoming 
  micro-batches to the sink, this is more useful in a stateless operation where saving the previous state is not much of a use. State-store is a data store 
  which stores the previously processed micro-batches so that any aggregation logic can be applied to the entire contextual data. Going through the stateful
   operations adds more delay on the final delivery of the data to sink since an additional check and 'logic apply' has to be preformed.

✦ That's a clear explanation of the different output modes. You've correctly identified that stateful operations introduce latency.


  Now, let's connect this back to your earlier mention of "late arriving data." How do watermarks specifically help in managing state and dealing with
  late data in a stateful streaming query? Can you walk me through a scenario?

> For stateful streaming, along with Triggers, window and watermark configurations as equally important as well. Let's say a window of 5 mins has been 
  configured, that means a state will be maintained for every 5 mins for the incoming data. But in the real-world scenario, data can arrive late. If a data 
  belongs to a window from 2:00 to 2:05, arrives at 2:08 then such a data is called Late-Arriving Data.To process this we need to set Watermarks config in 
  our pipeline which acts as a watcher for late arrivals. Lets say we have set a watermark of 3 mins, then that gives a total window of 8 minutes for all 
  the aggregations to be applied.

✦ You're on the right track. A watermark of 3 minutes on a 5-minute window is a good example.


  Let's get more specific. How does the Spark engine use that 3-minute watermark to decide when to stop accepting late data for a particular window? For
  instance, using your example of the 2:00-2:05 window, at what point in time will the engine finalize the aggregation for that window and discard its
  state? What is the underlying mechanism?

> Okay. Lets get with an assuamption that every incoming data has a timestamp attached to it. I have a window of 5 mins and watermark of 3 mins for the 
  window to handle late arriving data. One message which has the timestamp of 2:04 and belongs to the window of 2:00 to 2:05, arrives at 2:07. In this 
  scenario, the window has passed but the watermark watcher is still active for the window, hence this message will be accepted since watermark watches till
   2:08. Once this mark is crossed, the aggregation will be finalized for the window and the state is discarded. Lets suppose the data with timestamp 2:04 
  arrives at 2:10 then such messages which are completely off the track can be routed to a dead letter queue for batch processing of discarded records. Can 
  you please put more light for the solution of this part of the question: "at what point in time will the engine finalize the aggregation for that window 
  and discard its
    state? What is the underlying mechanism"

✦ You've described the behavior perfectly. The message arriving at 2:07 is accepted, and the one at 2:10 is dropped. That's correct.

  Now, let's uncover the "underlying mechanism" together, as you asked.


  The engine doesn't use the wall-clock time (the real-world time on the server) to make this decision. Instead, it tracks time based on the timestamps
  within the data itself.


  With that in mind, think about this: In every micro-batch, Spark sees a new set of events, each with its own timestamp. How do you think Spark
  determines the "current time" from the perspective of the data stream?

> I am not sure about this question, can you provide me a detailed answer

✦ Of course. Let's walk through it.


  The key is that Spark tracks the maximum event time it has seen so far across all the data that has arrived. Let's call this maxEventTime.


  Every time a new batch of data arrives, Spark looks at all the timestamps in that batch, finds the latest one, and updates its maxEventTime if the new
  timestamp is greater.


  Now, here's where your 3-minute watermark comes in. The watermark is always calculated as:

  watermark_level = maxEventTime - watermark_delay


  So, in your example, the watermark delay is 3 minutes. If the latest event Spark has processed has a timestamp of 2:10, the watermark level is updated
  to 2:10 - 3 minutes = 2:07.


  This watermark level, 2:07, is the crucial value. It's a threshold that tells Spark: "I will no longer accept any data with a timestamp older than
  2:07."


  Therefore, any window that ends before this watermark level is considered "closed." The engine finalizes the aggregation for that window, emits the
  result, and—most importantly—discards its state from the state store. This is how Spark avoids its state from growing indefinitely.


  So, for your 2:00-2:05 window, as soon as the maxEventTime reaches 2:08, the watermark becomes 2:05. At that point, the 2:00-2:05 window is closed, and
  its state is dropped.


  Does that mechanism make sense?

> yes

✦ Great. Let's move on to a different aspect of Structured Streaming.


  Imagine you have a streaming job that reads from Kafka, performs a simple filter operation, and writes the result to a Parquet sink. The job runs fine
  for a few hours, but then the business team reports that the data in the Parquet files is being duplicated.


  What are the potential causes for this data duplication, and how would you go about debugging and fixing the issue?

> To solve the issue for duplicates, before calling the load() in write stream, the deduplicate() API has to be invoked to the transformed Dataframe and 
  then Writestraem should be performed. Can you provide me real-world scenario reasons on why dupliactes are created in stateful stream processing.

✦ Using .dropDuplicates() is a valid way to handle duplicates in the data itself, so that's a good tool to know.


  However, my question is about why the system might be creating duplicates in the sink, even if the source data from Kafka is unique. This is a very
  common real-world problem.


  Let's think about the lifecycle of a streaming job. What happens if your Spark application crashes unexpectedly and is then automatically restarted by
  the cluster manager (like YARN or Kubernetes)? Consider the interaction between Spark, its checkpoint location, and the Parquet sink in this failure
  scenario. What could go wrong to cause duplicates?

> Structured streaming application maintains a record of the offsets of previously processed messages in DFS space called checkpoint directory. This 
  directory contains contents like metadata, offsets, and commits. Commits will show the commited points of data that has been completely extracted. The 
  offsets will have the "partition:Offset" values of the commited offsets from Kafka partitions. At the start of the streaming application first this 
  checkpoint directory will be scanned, if this directory is empty then its a green signal for the app and it will start with either "latest" or 
  "earliest"(configured by developer with kafka.start.offset) available offsets from kafka topic. But, at the start, if app sees that this directory is 
  empty then the application will attempt to start from the last committed offset from the offsets of checkpoint directory, thinking that it is restarting 
  the app from a failure point. Provided a condition that the last committed offsets are still available at consumer group offsets, some part of the data 
  gets duplicated. But, if the last committed offsets are not available at consumer group offsets then the application will simply restart with an endless 
  wait.

✦ You have correctly and very thoroughly described how checkpointing works for the source (Kafka). You've perfectly explained how Spark uses the checkpoint
  to know which offsets to read from after a restart, ensuring it doesn't miss source data.


  Now, let's focus on the other end of the pipeline: the sink.


  Let's imagine this sequence of events:
   1. Spark reads micro-batch #10 (offsets 1000-1100).
   2. It processes the data.
   3. It successfully writes the resulting Parquet files for batch #10 to HDFS.
   4. CRASH! The application fails before it can write to its checkpoint that it has successfully processed batch #10.


  When the application restarts, what will it do, based on your description of how checkpointing works? And what will be the result in the Parquet
  directory?

> At the time of CRASH, the last committed offset is still #9, as in the offsets of micro-batch #10 has not commited yet. On restart the application will 
  start reading from the offsets of micro-batch #9, and then, after commits, the application will again read the offets 1000-1100 for microbatch #10. As a 
  result, the Parquet sink has duplicates with #9 and #10.

✦ Exactly! You've pinpointed the root cause.


  Just a small correction: If batch #9 was successfully committed, the checkpoint would have recorded that. So on restart, the application would re-read
  micro-batch #10 (offsets 1000-1100), because that's the first batch that wasn't successfully marked as complete in the checkpoint.

  But your conclusion is perfectly correct: it re-processes batch #10 and writes it to the Parquet sink again, resulting in duplicate data.


  This demonstrates a fundamental challenge in streaming systems: the write to the sink and the write to the checkpoint are not a single, atomic
  operation.


  So, knowing this is the cause, how can you design your pipeline to prevent this duplication? Simply using .dropDuplicates() might hide the issue, but
  it doesn't solve the underlying systemic problem. What property must a sink have to handle this scenario correctly?

> Can you provide me a detailed answer for this.

✦ You're right, this is a complex topic. The key property the sink must have is idempotency.


  An idempotent sink means that writing the same batch of data multiple times has the exact same effect as writing it only once. If the sink is
  idempotent, when Spark restarts and re-writes batch #10, the sink handles it gracefully and no duplicates are created in the final, visible data.


  There are two main ways to achieve this with Structured Streaming:


   1. Use a Sink that is Naturally Idempotent:
       * Example: Any key-value store (like Cassandra, HBase, or a relational database) where you are using the primary key of the data to UPSERT (update
         or insert). If you write the same row twice, the second write just overwrites the first one with the identical data, so there's no change.


   2. Use a Transactional Sink:
       * This is the more robust solution, especially for file-based sinks like Parquet, ORC, etc. These sinks support transactions that are tied to the
         Spark checkpointing mechanism.
       * How it works: The sink uses a two-phase commit protocol. When Spark writes a batch, the data is first written to a temporary, staging location.
         Only after Spark successfully writes the offset to its checkpoint log does it "commit" the transaction, which moves the staged files into the
         final destination directory.
       * `foreachBatch` with a Transactional Sink: This is the most common pattern. Inside foreachBatch, you can connect to a transactional system (like
         Delta Lake, or a relational database with explicit transaction BEGIN/COMMIT logic) and wrap your write operation in a transaction that you
         control.


  In your specific scenario with a Parquet sink, the best practice solution is to use a transactional table format like Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg.
  They are designed specifically to solve this problem. When you write a DataFrame to a Delta table, the operation is atomic and idempotent. If the job
  fails and retries, the transaction metadata ensures that the batch is only committed once, preventing duplicates.


  So, the fix would be to change your sink from spark.writeStream.format("parquet") to spark.writeStream.format("delta").


  Does this distinction between idempotent and non-idempotent sinks make sense?

> yes

✦ Excellent. Let's try a conceptual design question.


  A client wants to build a real-time dashboard that shows the "Top 10 most popular hashtags" on Twitter over a moving 1-hour window, updated every 10
  seconds.


  Assuming you have a Kafka stream providing raw tweet data (each message is a JSON object containing the tweet text and a timestamp), how would you
  design a Spark Structured Streaming application to solve this?


  Please describe the key transformations, the windowing strategy, and the output mode you would use.

> I want to understand more on the question. When you said "moving 1-hour window" for dahsboard, does it mean that the metrics in dashboard should be 
  updated every hour and the underlying data, i.e., the pipeline should update the base data with a trigger of 10 seconds?

✦ That's a great clarifying question. It gets to the heart of how "sliding windows" work.


  "Moving 1-hour window" (or a sliding window) means that at any given moment, the calculation should be based on the data from the most recent 60 
  minutes. The window itself moves forward in time.

  "Updated every 10 seconds" is the frequency of the calculation.


  So, putting it together: Every 10 seconds, your Spark job should calculate and output a new list of the Top 10 hashtags based on the tweets that
  occurred in the 60-minute period immediately preceding it.


  For example:
   - At 10:00:10 AM, the dashboard shows the top hashtags from tweets between 9:00:10 AM and 10:00:10 AM.
   - At 10:00:20 AM, the dashboard shows the top hashtags from tweets between 9:00:20 AM and 10:00:20 AM.
   - ...and so on.

  The window has a duration of 1 hour and slides every 10 seconds.


  With this clarification, can you describe the design?

> Thank you for the explanation. With this description, the requirements seems like this is a pull based model. Structured streaming is a great tool for a 
  pull-based requirement. Since this architecture is event drivern, I would like to source all the events through Kafka, it will act as a perfect buffer for
   me to extract and perform analytics. The question specifies a sliding window of 1 hour updated every 10 seconds, that clarifies that the trigger for this
   straeming application should be every 10 seconds and that window that should be set for this is 60 minutes. For most popular hashtags, I will write a 
  necessary custom transformation logic for aggregating the counts of hashtags and write this to a Key-value No-SQL store like Cassandra. The trigger for 
  every 10 seconds will pull the lastest data and the window for 1 hour will give the aggregations to be applied for data in last one-hour window avaialble 
  in the RocksDB. This aggregated data is then written to cassandra and the offsets are committed to the checkpoint directory, post data-write.

✦ That's a very solid high-level design. You've correctly identified all the key components: Kafka as the source, Cassandra as a suitable low-latency sink
  for a dashboard, and the correct window and trigger durations.


  Let's dive into the Spark code itself. Can you write down the core Spark Structured Streaming snippet that would implement this logic?


  Please focus on:
   1. Reading from Kafka.
   2. Parsing the JSON and extracting the tweet text and timestamp.
   3. The transformation to find and count hashtags within the sliding window.
   4. The correct output mode for this type of aggregation.


  You don't need to write the sink-specific code for Cassandra (e.g., the foreachBatch logic), just get the final aggregated DataFrame ready. Assume the
  incoming DataFrame from Kafka has a value column (as a string) containing the JSON.

> Sure. I might not write the executable code snippet but i will try to write the logic for the flow

✦ Of course. A logical flow or detailed pseudo-code is perfectly fine. Please walk me through the sequence of transformations you would apply to the
  initial DataFrame read from Kafka.


  Describe each step, from parsing the raw data to the final aggregated result.

> Okay. The Utility should be designed to execute in a particluar manner and that is Extraction, Transformation and Loading. Here is the extraction part: 
  val sourceDF = 
  spark.readStream.format('kafka').options('kafka.broker.list','.........').options('kafka.topic.name',"").options('kafka.start.offset','.....'). After 
  this, custom transformations have to be applied to the sourceDF, val transformedDF = sourceDF.(<custom transformation for count aggregations>). Our final 
  step will be to load this Dataframe to cassandra, transformedDF.writeStream.format('cassandra').option('user','.....').option('schema','.....').option('ta
  ble','.....').option('server','.....').option(key,'......').trigger("10 seconds").window("60 minutes").watermark("5 minutes").start()

✦ You've provided the skeleton for the read and write operations, which is a good start.


  However, the most critical part of this problem is the comment you left: (<custom transformation for count aggregations>). This is where the main logic
  resides.


  Let's focus exclusively on that part. Assume you have sourceDF from Kafka. The value column is a JSON string like {"timestamp": "2025-09-21T10:00:00Z", 
  "text": "Spark is amazing! #BigData #Spark"}.


  Can you detail the sequence of DataFrame operations to get from sourceDF to a final DataFrame that has three columns: window, hashtag, and count,
  sorted to show the top 10 for each window?


  Think about functions like withColumn, from_json, explode, split, filter, groupBy, window, and orderBy.

> I am not sure, as my experience scope does not fall under constructing dataframes for a NoSQL DB. Can you provide detailed explanation for this.

✦ No problem at all. Let's walk through it. The logic for the transformation is actually independent of the sink; it would be the same whether you were
  writing to Cassandra, the console, or a file.

  Here is a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the transformations.


  Let's start with your sourceDF.

  Step 1: Parse the JSON data

  First, we need to parse the JSON string in the value column. We define a schema that matches the JSON structure and use the from_json function.



    1 import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
    2 import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
    3 
    4 // Assume 'sourceDF' is your streaming DataFrame from Kafka
    5 // val sourceDF = spark.readStream...
    6 
    7 val jsonSchema = new StructType()
    8   .add("timestamp", StringType)
    9   .add("text", StringType)
   10 
   11 val parsedDF = sourceDF
   12   .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), jsonSchema).as("data"))
   13   .select("data.*")

   * Result: A DataFrame with timestamp (string) and text (string) columns.


  Step 2: Cast Timestamp and Add Watermark

  Windowing operations require a proper timestamp column. We'll cast our string timestamp to a Spark TimestampType and define the watermark on it.



   1 val timedDF = parsedDF
   2   .withColumn("eventTime", to_timestamp(col("timestamp")))
   3   .withWatermark("eventTime", "5 minutes") // Watermark for late data

   * Result: A DataFrame with text (string) and eventTime (timestamp) columns. The 5-minute watermark is arbitrary but good practice.


  Step 3: Extract Hashtags

  This is a multi-part step. We split the text into words, create a new row for each word (explode), and then filter for only the words that are
  hashtags.



   1 val hashtagsDF = timedDF
   2   .withColumn("word", explode(split(col("text"), " ")))
   3   .filter(col("word").startsWith("#"))
   4   .withColumnRenamed("word", "hashtag")

   * Result: A DataFrame with rows like (..., "eventTime", "#BigData"), (..., "eventTime", "#Spark").

  Step 4: Perform the Windowed Aggregation

  Now we group by the sliding window and the hashtag itself, and then count the occurrences.



   1 val aggregatedDF = hashtagsDF
   2   .groupBy(
   3     window(col("eventTime"), "1 hour", "10 seconds"), // The sliding window
   4     col("hashtag")
   5   )
   6   .count()

   * Result: A DataFrame with columns window, hashtag, and count. This gives the count for each hashtag within each active 10-second sliding window.


  Step 5: Get the Top 10 (The Final Piece)


  You cannot use a simple orderBy().limit(10) on a streaming DataFrame because it's an unsupported global sort. The correct way to do ranking is inside a
  foreachBatch block. You would take the output of aggregatedDF and, for each micro-batch, apply standard batch DataFrame logic to get the top 10.

  The logic inside foreachBatch would look like this:



    1 // This logic goes inside the .foreachBatch() call
    2 import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window
    3 
    4 val windowSpec = Window.partitionBy("window").orderBy(col("count").desc)
    5 
    6 val rankedDF = batchDF // 'batchDF' is the output of 'aggregatedDF' for one trigger
    7   .withColumn("rank", rank().over(windowSpec))
    8   .filter(col("rank") <= 10)
    9   .select("window", "hashtag", "count")
   10 
   11 // Now, you would write 'rankedDF' to Cassandra


  Finally, you'd use Update as your output mode, because you are continuously updating the counts for the sliding windows.


  This entire sequence gives you the correct, updated Top 10 list every 10 seconds. Does breaking it down like this make the transformation logic
  clearer?

> yes

✦ Great. I think that covers the main areas I wanted to discuss. You have a good foundational understanding of Structured Streaming, especially around the
  core concepts of sources, sinks, and checkpointing. Your high-level design instincts are solid. The areas to continue building on are the specific
  DataFrame transformations for more complex aggregations and the nuances of handling stateful operations like ranking.


  Thank you for walking through these questions with me. That concludes the interview. Do you have any questions for me?

> Give me a brief explanation about Kafka consumer offsets and how is it related to the offsets committed in the checkpoint directory. Also, what role does 
  it play when a structured streaming application crashes?

✦ Excellent question. It gets to the core of how Structured Streaming guarantees end-to-end fault tolerance. Let's break it down.

  1. Kafka Consumer Offsets


   * What they are: Think of this as Kafka's own internal bookmark. For a given group.id (a consumer group), Kafka tracks which message offset has been
     last processed for each partition. This is stored in an internal Kafka topic called __consumer_offsets.
   * How they work: When a standard Kafka consumer (not Spark) reads a message, it periodically "commits" the offset back to the Kafka broker. If that
     consumer crashes, a new consumer in the same group can start reading from the last committed offset.
   * The Key Point: Spark Structured Streaming completely ignores this mechanism. It does not use a group.id and never commits offsets back to the
     __consumer_offsets topic in Kafka.

  2. Spark's Checkpoint Offsets


   * What they are: This is Spark's own, private record of its progress. Inside the checkpoint directory you provide, Spark creates a sub-directory named
     offsets. In here, for each batch, it writes a file containing the exact Kafka partition and offset range it has processed. For example:
     {"topic-A":{"0":1234,"1":5678}}, meaning it has processed up to offset 1234 on partition 0 and 5678 on partition 1.
   * How they work: This file is written as the very last step of a micro-batch, after the data has been successfully written to the sink. This is part of
     the transactional guarantee.

  3. The Relationship and Role in a Crash


  Here is the crucial difference and how they relate during a failure:


   1. Reading: When a Spark job starts, it looks at its own checkpoint offsets directory to decide where to begin reading. It asks Kafka, "Give me data for
      partition 0 starting from offset 1235," completely ignoring whatever is in Kafka's __consumer_offsets.

   2. Processing: It processes the new batch of data (e.g., offsets 1235-1300).

   3. Writing: It writes the output to the sink (e.g., Parquet, Delta Lake, Cassandra).

   4. Committing: Only after the sink write is successful, Spark writes a new file to its checkpoint offsets directory, saying it has now completed up to
      offset 1300.

  When a crash happens:


  Imagine the job crashes after step 3 but before step 4. The sink has the data for offsets 1235-1300, but Spark's checkpoint still says the last
  completed offset was 1234.


  When the application restarts:
   * It ignores Kafka's consumer offsets.
   * It reads its own checkpoint and sees the last successful offset was 1234.
   * It asks Kafka to replay the data starting from offset 1235.
   * It re-processes the batch (1235-1300) and writes it to the sink again.


  This is why Spark's checkpoint is the single source of truth for the streaming query's progress. It ensures no data from the source is ever lost
  (at-least-once processing). And as we discussed, this replay mechanism is precisely why you need an idempotent sink to avoid duplicates and achieve
  exactly-once semantics.

> Lets suppose the streaming application has crashed and a manually intervention is needed to fix the logic. The logic is fixed and the streaming 
  application is restarted but the fresh offsets are not getting committed and kafka is not extracting the last committed offset also. Everything seems to 
  be fine at the source, i.e., kafka topic. What might be the reason

✦ That is an excellent and very practical question that trips up many developers. The most likely reason for this behavior is a fundamental rule in
  Structured Streaming:

  You cannot change the logical plan of a streaming query and restart it from an existing checkpoint directory.


  When you run a streaming query, Spark saves more than just the Kafka offsets in the checkpoint directory. It also saves the entire query plan (the
  schema, the transformations, aggregations, etc.) and, for stateful queries, all the state data.


  When you restart the application, Spark does the following:
   1. It loads the metadata from the checkpoint directory.
   2. It compares the query plan from the old run with the query plan generated by your new, modified code.
   3. If they do not match, Spark cannot safely continue. It doesn't know how to apply the old state (if any) to the new logic. To prevent data corruption
      or incorrect results, it will throw an AnalysisException and refuse to start processing new batches.

  The error message you should look for in your driver logs will be very similar to this:
  "Cannot restart query with different logical plan..."


  Your application isn't "stuck" in the sense of being in a deadlock. It has most likely failed during the initialization phase, but the driver process
  might still be running, making it look like it's just not doing anything.

  How to Fix It

  You have two primary options, depending on your goal:


   1. Start a Fresh Stream (Most Common): If you are deploying a new version of your logic and don't need to preserve the exact state of the old stream, the
      solution is to delete the checkpoint directory before restarting. The application will see no checkpoint exists and start as a brand new stream,
      pulling the latest or earliest data from Kafka as configured.


   2. Run a New Stream in Parallel: The safer production approach is to never modify a stream in place. Instead, you start the new, modified application
      with a brand new checkpoint directory. You let the old stream run until it's no longer needed, and the new stream starts its work in parallel. This
      allows for zero-downtime migrations.


  In summary: Your application is almost certainly halting on startup because your code modifications created a new query plan that is incompatible with
  the one saved in your checkpoint. You need to start with a fresh checkpoint to use the new logic.

> but what if the streaming was stateless. The streaming application is using append only mode with no window or watermark.

✦ That's an excellent and very precise follow-up. You are correct that in a stateless, append-only stream, there is no intermediate state (like aggregation
  results) to worry about.

  However, the application will still fail to restart for the same fundamental reason.


  The checkpoint directory contains a metadata file which holds a unique ID and the serialized logical plan of the original query. When Spark restarts,
  it always compares the logical plan of the new code against the one stored in the metadata.


  Even if the change is minor and seems safe for a stateless query, like changing a filter condition or adding a withColumn transformation, it alters the
  logical plan.

  Old Code: sourceDF.filter("value > 10")
  New Code: sourceDF.filter("value > 20")


  Spark's restart mechanism does not differentiate between stateful and stateless queries in this regard. It applies a strict, blanket policy: if the 
  logical plan has changed in any way, the restart from the same checkpoint is rejected.


  This is a deliberate design choice to guarantee absolute consistency and prevent any unintended consequences of mixing logic between runs. It forces
  the developer to be explicit about starting a new stream when the code changes.


  So, the diagnosis and the solution are exactly the same as for a stateful query:
   * Reason: The logical plan in your new code doesn't match the plan stored in the checkpoint's metadata.
   * Solution: You must delete the checkpoint directory or start the new application with a new, empty checkpoint directory.


  The only difference is that for a stateless query, the consequence of deleting the checkpoint is much lower. You lose no valuable state, only the
  record of the source offsets.

> okay, what if there is no logic change and yet I am seeing same behaviour while restart.

✦ Excellent question. If you are 100% certain there are no code changes, then the "logical plan mismatch" error is ruled out. The issue is almost certainly
  environmental or due to the state of the checkpoint itself.

  Here are the most likely culprits in this scenario, in order of probability:


  1. Spark Version Mismatch


  This is the most common cause in real-world operations.
   * The Problem: The internal format of checkpoint files is not guaranteed to be compatible across different Spark versions. For example, a checkpoint
     created with Spark 3.2.1 might be unreadable by Spark 3.3.0.
   * How it Happens: An environment was upgraded, or the job was submitted to a different cluster or queue that has a different Spark version configured.
   * What to Look For: In your driver logs, you will see an exception related to deserialization right at the start, such as java.io.InvalidClassException,
     IncompatibleClassChangeError, or other serialization-related errors when Spark tries to read the metadata or state files.
   * The Fix: Ensure the Spark version (spark-submit, cluster environment, etc.) you are using to restart is identical to the one that created the
     checkpoint.

  2. Checkpoint File Corruption


   * The Problem: The checkpoint itself is damaged. This can happen if there was a hard crash, a network filesystem glitch (on HDFS/S3), or a disk error
     while a checkpoint file was being written. One of the files inside the checkpoint directory (metadata, commits, offsets, or a state snapshot) is
     incomplete or unreadable.
   * What to Look For: You'll see I/O-related errors in the driver logs, like java.io.IOException, EOFException (End of File Exception), or a file parsing
     error when Spark tries to read its own checkpoint files.
   * The Fix: This is very difficult to repair manually. The most practical solution is to abandon the checkpoint. You have to move or delete the corrupted
     checkpoint directory and start a fresh stream. You will have a data gap to deal with, but it's often the only way forward.

  3. Incompatible Change in Dependencies


   * The Problem: Your application code is the same, but a library it depends on has changed. For example, if your job uses a custom class in a stateful
     operation (mapGroupsWithState) and the definition of that class (or a class it uses) has changed in a shared utility JAR file.
   * What to Look For: This would likely manifest as a java.io.InvalidClassException or similar deserialization error when Spark tries to read the state
     information from the checkpoint and deserialize it using the new class definition from the updated JAR.
   * The Fix: You must revert the dependency to the exact version that was used by the original job.

  Debugging Action Plan:


   1. Scrutinize the Driver Logs: Don't just look for the absence of activity. Look for the very first exception that occurs after the "Starting query"
      message. This is your primary clue.
   2. Confirm Spark Version: Run spark-shell --version in the exact environment you are using for the restart and verify it matches the original job's
      environment.
   3. Inspect the Checkpoint Directory: Check the modification times of the files in the checkpoint directory on HDFS/S3. An incomplete or zero-byte file in
      the commits or offsets directory can be a sign of corruption.


  In 99% of cases where the code hasn't changed, the root cause is either a Spark version mismatch or a corrupted checkpoint.
